uuidtime is a Linux program to generate an UUID of current time based on
seconds and microseconds since epoch(1970). I started this project when I
realized I couldn't sort many UUID from 'uuidgen -t'. The real UUIDs use
multiple factors to assure unicity of the id, but uuidtime only relies on
microseconds precision to ensure it can generate an acceptable unique id.
So to resume there are greater chances to hit a collision with this
program than with uuidgen.

You can compile the source code by running 'make' in the source directory.
There is no install mechanism, just copy the resulting executable wherever
you see fit, ie. to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /opt/bin.

user@hostname$ ./uuidtime
00000000-0119-0008-0026-5d8ccbea065bf2

user@hostname$ for i in `seq 1 4`; do ./uuidtime; sleep 1; done
00000000-0119-0008-0026-5d8ccc440a19de
00000000-0119-0008-0026-5d8ccc450a2b6c
00000000-0119-0008-0026-5d8ccc460a4ddf
00000000-0119-0008-0026-5d8ccc470a67c8

The format is 00000000-yyyy-mmmm-dddd-hhhhhhnnnnnn
