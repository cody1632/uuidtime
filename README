uuidtime is a Linux program to generate an UUID of current time based on
seconds and microseconds since epoch(1970). I started this project when I
realized I couldn't sort many UUID from 'uuidgen -t'. The real UUIDs use
multiple factors to assure unicity of the id, but uuidtime only relies on
microseconds precision and 3 random bytes to ensure it can generate an 
acceptable unique id. So to resume there are greater chances to hit a 
collision with this program than with uuidgen.

You can compile the source code by running 'make' in the source directory.
There is no install mechanism, just copy the resulting executable wherever
you see fit, ie. to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /opt/bin.

user@hostname$ ./uuidtime
00007708-1a00-005d-8cea-d208805b9260

user@hostname$ for i in `seq 1 4`; do ./uuidtime; done
00007708-1a00-005d-8cea-d2088a07bf1e
00007708-1a00-005d-8cea-d2088eac7793
